This is a simple file manager app. I made this app for my own education.

The app is built using ExpressJS & Nodejs. 

Making this project helped me learn alot about web development:

+ How a Request is processed by the server and how it responses.
+ File processing 
+ Cookie based authentication
+ Working with Session & Cookie
